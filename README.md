# DENR Travel Order Information System (DENR-TOIS)

A comprehensive Travel Order Management System for the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) built with Laravel 10 and Tailwind CSS 3. This system streamlines the process of creating, managing, and tracking travel orders within the organization.

## ðŸ“‹ System Workflow

### Travel Order Request Process

1. **Request Creation**
   - Any user can create a travel order request
   - Each request requires:
     - Basic travel details (dates, destination, purpose)
     - Selection of one Recommender
     - Selection of one Approver
   - System validations:
     - Recommender and Approver must be different users
     - User cannot be both Recommender and Approver for the same request
     - User cannot be Recommender/Approver for their own request
   - Status: Set to "Pending/For Recommendation" upon creation

2. **Recommendation Phase**
   - The assigned Recommender receives the travel order
   - Actions available:
     - Review travel order details
     - Attach e-signature to recommend
     - Forward to Approver
   - Status: Changes to "For Approval" after recommendation

3. **Approval Phase**
   - The assigned Approver receives the travel order
   - Actions available:
     - Review travel order and recommendation
     - Attach e-signature to approve
     - System automatically assigns an official travel order number upon approval
   - Status: Changes to "Approved" with O.R. number

### User Roles and Permissions
